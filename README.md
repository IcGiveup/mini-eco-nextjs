📌 About This Project

I built this Mini E-Commerce frontend as part of a technical evaluation task for a Frontend Developer Intern position.

The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and well-structured application using Next.js and React. While building this project, I focused on writing organized code, separating logic properly, and keeping the UI simple but professional.

🛠 What I Implemented

Product listing page with image, title, price, and short description

Dynamic filtering by category and price range

Pagination

Product details page using dynamic routing

Loading skeleton for better user experience

Proper error handling

Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)

⚙️ Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router)

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

DummyJSON API

📂 Project Structure

I organized the project to keep things clean and maintainable:

app/ → Pages and routing

components/ → Reusable UI components

services/ → API logic

types/ → TypeScript interfaces

This structure makes it easier to scale or modify in the future.

💡 My Approach

Used reusable components to avoid duplication

Kept API logic separate from UI

Applied TypeScript for better type safety

Implemented filtering on the client side for smoother interaction

Added loading skeleton to improve user experience
